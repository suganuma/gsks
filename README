sorry , my english is too noncommittal.
I do not secure any damages from using this script.


Explanation:
GSKS aims for enabling you to operate 'google scholar' only with keyboard.

This script occupies the following keys.

j , k = move forward or backward
o , Enter = open link
l = open reference link if exists
i = open pdf link if exists
[ = select paper title 
n , p = move the next or previous search results
. = focus search bar
esc = unfocus search bar

and, your search bar extends.

Enjoy!
